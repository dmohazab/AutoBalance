# AutoBalance
A personal mobile application developed using android studio to reduce balancing
time while I was working at ScotiaBank. The app takes in user inputs from front and backend treasury locations 
compiles the data to return a final amount in which you would enter into Scotiabank's built in closing software. 
Rather than follow in the path of my coworkers and predecessors (pencil, paper, calculator, and lots of wasted time), 
I used this app to make closing for the day quick and efficient.
